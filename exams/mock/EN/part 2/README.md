# Prep Partial Exam: Part in the IDE

As preparation for the LEHO quiz of the partial exam, you already completed
the mock LEHO quiz (if not: do this as soon as possible). For the part in the IDE,
it’s best to also complete this mock exam: we only provide technical support
during the real exam if you correctly completed this mock assignment.

Just like the regular exercises, the actual assignment is in comments inside the js file,
and a few tests are provided. Unlike the exercises, you still need to add these files
to your repository yourself.

## Place the files in the correct location

In the folder of this README, you will find two js files:

 - `pe-demo.js`
 - `pe-demo-test.js`

In the exercises folder (this folder already exists) of your own repo,
create a new folder called pe. This folder doesn’t exist yet, but you will
also need to use it during the exam. Place pe-demo.js in this new folder.

Now place the file pe-demo-test.js in the test folder of your own repo (this folder already exists).

## Test setup

If you now run the test file de-demo-test.js, the first test will pass,
the others will not. That’s good! Make a commit now.

If anything is off then check your folder structure against the paths and names used in the files.

## Make the exercise

Now complete the assignment. It should go smoothly.
The assignment on the actual exam will be longer and more complex.
When you’re done, all tests should pass except the first one (that’s intentional).
*You may remove that test case if it bothers you.*
The linter should also not have any complaints about your code.
Make another commit (you can make more if you like), and push your solution.

Everything is successful if you also see your file(s) on the GitLab website.

IMPORTANT! Upload the solution file to this assignment as well!
