/*
# Isosceles 4
Write a program similar to "Isosceles 1".
This time triangle is right aligned and has its top on top.

**NOTE:** The goal of these exercises is to practice the use and implementation of iteration
(using `while` and/or `for`). Avoid the use of built-in (string) functions such as `repeat` (or others)
as they defeat the purpose of the exercise.

## Example
    > -3
    > 0
    > 5
        *
       **
      ***
     ****
    *****
