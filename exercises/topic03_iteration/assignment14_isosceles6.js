/*
# Isosceles 6
Write a program similar to "Isosceles 5".
This time the triangle has its top at the bottom.

**NOTE:** The goal of these exercises is to practice the use and implementation of iteration
(using `while` and/or `for`). Avoid the use of built-in (string) functions such as `repeat` (or others)
as they defeat the purpose of the exercise.

## Example
    > -3
    > 0
    > 5
    *****
     ***
      *

    > -3
    > 0
    > 4
    ****
     **
