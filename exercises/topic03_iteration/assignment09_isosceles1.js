/*
# Isosceles 1
Write a program that asks for the height of an isosceles right triangle.
This is a right triangle with the two legs
(and their corresponding angles) equal.

Print such a triangle on screen using `*`.
The triangle is left aligned and has its top on top.

Negative or zero heights are not accepted. Keep on asking for a correct
height until a positive number is entered.

**NOTE:** The goal of these exercises is to practice the use and implementation of iteration
(using `while` and/or `for`). Avoid the use of built-in (string) functions such as `repeat` (or others)
as they defeat the purpose of the exercise.

## Example
    > -3
    > 0
    > 5
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
    *****
