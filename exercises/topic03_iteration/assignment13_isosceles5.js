/*
# Isosceles 5
Write a program similar to "Isosceles 2".
This time triangle is centered and has its top on top.
Watch out, not all triangles have a top with 1 star. Some have two stars.

**NOTE:** The goal of these exercises is to practice the use and implementation of iteration
(using `while` and/or `for`). Avoid the use of built-in (string) functions such as `repeat` (or others)
as they defeat the purpose of the exercise.

## Example
    > -3
    > 0
    > 5
      *
     ***
    *****

    > -3
    > 0
    > 4
     **
    ****
