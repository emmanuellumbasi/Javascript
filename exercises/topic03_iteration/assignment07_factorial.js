# Factorial
Ask for a positive number (``int``) as input and output its factorial.

The factorial of a number n is n! with n! = n * (n-1) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1
The factorial of 0, 0! is 1 by definition

For negative numbers the factorial is not defined. In this case you can
simply print `does not compute`.
