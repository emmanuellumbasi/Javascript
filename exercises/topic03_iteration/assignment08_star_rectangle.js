/*
# Star Rectangle
Write a program that asks for two numerical inputs (`int`): the height and
the width of a rectangle. Print such a rectangle on screen using `*`.

The program has no output if either the height or the width is negative  or zero.

**NOTE:** The goal of these exercises is to practice the use and implementation of iteration
(using `while` and/or `for`). Avoid the use of built-in (string) functions such as `repeat` (or others)
as they defeat the purpose of the exercise.

## Example:
    > 4
    > 3
    ***
    ***
    ***
