# Centered Square (partial exam)

Create a JavaScript program that prints a square.
The edges should be pluses (`+`) and in the exact center,
there should be an oh (`o`).

It is only possible to place the `o` in the exact center if
the size of the square is odd. Moreover, the `o` is only visible, for sizes of 3 or higher.

Hence, keep asking for input, until it will yield a square with correctly drawn 'oh'.

**NOTE:** The goal of these exercises is to practice the use and implementation of iteration
(using `while` and/or `for`). Avoid the use of built-in (string) functions such as `repeat` (or others)
as they defeat the purpose of the exercise.

These are the three smallest possible squares:
> 3
+++
+o+
+++

> 5
+++++
+   +
+ o +
+   +
+++++

> 7
+++++++
+     +
+     +
+  o  +
+     +
+     +
+++++++
