# Highest frequency (II)
Write a program that asks for numerical input (integers)
between 0 and 99.
When the user inputs a number outside this interval
the program stops asking input.

Finally, print the number that was entered the most.
You can print -1 if there was no valid input.
If multiple numbers apply, print the largest.
