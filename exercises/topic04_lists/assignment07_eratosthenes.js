/*
# Sieve of Eratosthenes
Write a program that expects a positive integer as input.
This input is the upper bound.
Then, the program prints all prime numbers below that upper bound.
If the upper bound is a prime number itself, it should also be printed in the list.

**Hint 1:** Look up "Sieve of Eratosthenes" and implement this algorithm.
**Hint 2:** Skip this exercise if you have other exercises left to make.
