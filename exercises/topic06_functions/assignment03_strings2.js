/*
Write the functions
`reverse`,
`isPalindrome`,
`substringOfLength`,
`find`,
`findAll`,
 `replace`, and
 `decompose`
 such that all tests succeed.

The key of this exercise is to start small: make your
function work for simple and small inputs. Just like in
the previous exercise the key is to reuse existing functions.

*If the functionality you need already exists in
(a) JavaScript (library), try to implement it yourself.
The exercise here is to write code, not to borrow it.*
