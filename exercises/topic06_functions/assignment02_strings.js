# Basic text functions
Write the functions
`isDigit`,
`toUpper`,
`toLower`,
`isAlpha`,
`isInt`, and
`trim`.
All these functions should be written such that the tests succeed.
The goal of this exercise is to create a lot of
small helper functions and to re-use them.

You can make use of `char2ascii` and `ascii2char`
that respectively turn a character into an integer, and vice versa.

First play with these two functions until you understand how they work.
Then try to write a function `isBetween` this function can be used
to make extreme simple implementations of `isDigit` (0-9) and `isAlpha` (a-z and A-Z).

Further, for `trim`, you can make use of `isWhitespace`. Which might come in
handy, since the `trim` function should remove all leading and trailing whitespaces,
but should the whitespaces in between.
