# Rework your old exercises
Write the functions `gcd` (the greatest common divisor),
`swapDigits`,
`factorial`,
`variation`,
`avg` (average), and
`largestPrime`.

All these functions should be written such that the tests succeed.
Take a look at your previous programs for the algorithms.
The focus of this exercise, is to decide which parameters to use
and what your function should return.

When working on `variation` keep performance in mind! When the
tests for both `factorial` and `variation` succeed, take a
look at both functions: can you see that they share a big part
of code? Try to extract a function that I would call
`productRange` and use it in both `factorial` and `variation`.
Your tests should still succeed:
 this means your code still works. Changing a program
 (to improve its quality) without changing its solutions or
 outcomes is called *refactoring*.

 On exams, you are expected to do these refactorings (extract and reuse code)
 even when you are not explicitly asked to do so.
